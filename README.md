### Game Identity

A remake of the arcade game [Quantum](https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9189) made by [Betty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Betty_Ryan)

### Design Pillars

- Rolling
- Loops
- FLow

### Mechanics Summary

List what the game is from a gameplay and/or story perspective.

### Minimal Viable Interaction

A list of what needs to be playable to experience the core of your game. What will the player be able to do? Why only this? We may have a back and forth on this because this will be what I use to measure if you delivered an MVI.

### References

You must add a short description of how this is relevant to your game (mechanic, art, theme, etc.). There is no limit to how many references you can have.
